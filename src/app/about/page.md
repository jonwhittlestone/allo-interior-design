## About Us ...

We live in Surrey with our other halves, kids and dogs.

Previous to starting our interior design business, we have completed home staging for clients and estate agents, styling for pubs and worked on interior design projects for friends. Hannah is currently project managing her own home renovation from concept to completion.

Hannah has been an avid reader of House & Garden since the age of 6. Since the age of 11, she has been decorating her own house & planning renovations in home built camps! She regularly carries out various creative hobbies such as upcycling furniture, making pinboards, table decorating and wreath making.

Between us, we have done various interior design courses and RIBA seminars, as well as shadowing interior designers.

Steph specialises in textiles, upholstery, cushion and curtain making and also has a passion for painting.

We believe that family living shouldnt mean compromising on style
